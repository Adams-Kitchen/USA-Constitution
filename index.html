        <h2>Articles of the Constitution</h2>
        <p>The Constitution is built on seven foundational articles that define the framework of the U.S. government.</p>

        <!-- Article I -->
        <button class="dropdown-btn" onclick="toggleDropdown('article1')">Article I - The Legislative Branch</button>
        <div id="article1" class="dropdown-content" style="display: none;">
            <p>Article I establishes the legislative branch, consisting of the Senate and House of Representatives, collectively known as Congress. Congress is responsible for creating laws, levying taxes, declaring war, and regulating commerce. It also grants Congress the necessary and proper powers to carry out its duties, making it a central pillar of federal governance.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Article II -->
        <button class="dropdown-btn" onclick="toggleDropdown('article2')">Article II - The Executive Branch</button>
        <div id="article2" class="dropdown-content" style="display: none;">
            <p>Article II establishes the executive branch, which is headed by the President of the United States. It defines the President's powers, including the ability to veto legislation, command the military, and conduct foreign policy. The article also outlines the procedures for election, qualifications, and removal from office.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Article III -->
        <button class="dropdown-btn" onclick="toggleDropdown('article3')">Article III - The Judicial Branch</button>
        <div id="article3" class="dropdown-content" style="display: none;">
            <p>Article III establishes the judicial branch, including the Supreme Court and other inferior courts that Congress may create. The judicial branch is tasked with interpreting the laws and ensuring they are applied constitutionally. It grants lifetime appointments to judges, ensuring the judiciary remains independent of political pressures.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Article IV -->
        <button class="dropdown-btn" onclick="toggleDropdown('article4')">Article IV - The States</button>
        <div id="article4" class="dropdown-content" style="display: none;">
            <p>Article IV outlines the relationship between the states and the federal government. It requires states to give "full faith and credit" to the laws and judicial decisions of other states, ensures citizens have equal rights across states, and provides for the admission of new states.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Article V -->
        <button class="dropdown-btn" onclick="toggleDropdown('article5')">Article V - Amendments</button>
        <div id="article5" class="dropdown-content" style="display: none;">
            <p>Article V describes the process for amending the Constitution. Amendments can be proposed either by a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress or by a convention called for by two-thirds of state legislatures. Ratification requires approval from three-fourths of the states.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Article VI -->
        <button class="dropdown-btn" onclick="toggleDropdown('article6')">Article VI - The Supremacy Clause</button>
        <div id="article6" class="dropdown-content" style="display: none;">
            <p>Article VI establishes the Constitution, federal laws, and treaties as the "supreme law of the land," overriding conflicting state laws. It also requires federal and state officials to swear an oath to uphold the Constitution, but it prohibits any religious tests for holding public office.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Article VII -->
        <button class="dropdown-btn" onclick="toggleDropdown('article7')">Article VII - Ratification</button>
        <div id="article7" class="dropdown-content" style="display: none;">
            <p>Article VII outlines the procedure for ratification of the Constitution, stating that it would take effect once nine of the original thirteen states had ratified it. This article played a key role in the founding of the United States under a single, unified Constitution.</p>
